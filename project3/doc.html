    <h1>Nuclear Reactor Operator</h1>
    <p>Game Genres: Arcade, Other<br>Platform: PC</p>

    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>Survive the duration of your shift as a nuclear reactor operator by pressing all the right buttons in quick succesion to avoid a complete meltdown!</p>

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>You: a nuclear reactor operator have lots of bright red buttons to press. If you don't press them all in time, the reactor will explode! ...which is bad.</p>

    <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>
        The small enclosed control room the player operates from should be cartoony, with bright colors to indicate the importantance of each task.<br>
        The main sound effect will be pressing each button, but as task meters destabilize, they'll sound a small alarm to tell you they need attention.<br> 
        As more and more of them destablize all at once, the overlapping chaos will transform the once peaceful environment into a stressful management game.
    </p>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        The player is in charge of maintaining the stability of each meter on a control board in front of them.
        By using the mouse, the player will click the buttons on this board to increase the associated meter's stability, as the game goes on each meter will destabilize faster and faster.<br>
        Some tasks can only be stabilized at certain times while others require constant surveillance, the game becomes a balancing act of speed and prioritization.
        The game's slow start gives the player plenty of time to understand the premise without the chaos of the later half of the game. 
        An alarm indicates which meter is destabilized, and the brightly colored button draws the player's attention.
