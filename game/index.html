            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.<br>
                Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around.<br>
                The only weapon that you carry is an <strong>air pump</strong>, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they <strong>explode</strong>. [...]<p>
