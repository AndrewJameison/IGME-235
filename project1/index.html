                <h2>Minecraft</h2>
                <div>The best selling game in the industry is born, still massively popular after more than 10 years from its initial release. Minecraft popularized and perhaps defined the survival-crafting genre, it's seen countless spin offs and clones but none have come close to replacing its niche in the gaming industry.</div>

                <h2>DayZ</h2>
                <div>An equal partner in the rise of the survival-crafting genre was DayZ: the wildly popular mod for the military simulation game Arma II. It introduced more realistic survival mechanics beyond hunger and thirst, such as limb fractures and infection. Server hosts could easily customize the mod to fit their own preferences, letting players pick different servers that prioritized base building, PvP, or survival to name a few.</div>

                <div>Its origins dating back to the DayZ mod community, an offshoot known as <em>DayZ: Battle Royale</em> went on to become the best selling game on both PC and Xbox. PUBG is widely credited with popularizing the battleroyale genre, inspiring the rapidly growing industry.</div> 
                <div>In the wake of their massive success, PUBG filed several lawsuits against other games created within the genre - most notably against Epic Games for their production of Fortnite.</div>
