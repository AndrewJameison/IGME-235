_This is a simple text document for some spur of the moment inspiration..._

The Wizard Cube: A simple cube in posession of a magical wizard hat, fireballs and explosions are used both to attack and move around the game world

Replaceable: A run and gun shooter from the perspective of a killer bot, enemies are organic and can be mowed down easily. Your limbs however can be replaced - each limb takes damage, and if you lose too many you become vulnerable to attacks to your torso which will kill you

Ghostly Tenents: As the proprietary of a cemetary, your job is to make sure all your tenents stay in their respective graves. As the ghosts try and fly away, figure out where they each belong and throw em' back in there before they escape.
