        <div id="bio">My name is Andrew Jameison and I'm a 2nd year Game Design & Development major.
        My original plan when I first visited RIT was to study computer science with an interest in game design, but after learning there was a dedicated major I decided to take the plunge into GDD.
        If RIT has shown me one thing its that there is a lot more to the game design process than I had imagined, but its only sparked a greater passion to be involved in the process every step of the way.
        My hope for this class is that by expanding my skillset with CSS, HTML, and Javascript I'll become more selfsufficent as a developer.
        When I graduate I hope to be able to work on any number of platforms and in a variety of languages.</div>
